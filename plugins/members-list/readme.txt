== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When I click on a members link it goes nowehere. Why? =

The Members List Plugin does not handle your templates. Wordpress allows you to create a template file called "author.php" which should be placed in your theme's folder. It is this file that handles the displaying of each of your members. You can read about how to create this file here: `http://codex.wordpress.org/Author_Templates`
